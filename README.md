# APM
 :: Approximate Pattern Matching ::

This is a 16 bit pattern matching digital circuit. 

The slider loops across a register of 32 bits and decides whether there is a pattern match or not. 

There are 4 Don't Care slots in the slider.

The pattern-matcher will also output where the most significant bit match is located
